my wisdom, that thou mayest understand

out and his return in the morning, his words of
honey and his ways of guile.</p>

<p>Beloved, question me not, whence I have learned of
man, his secrets. Have I not known <em>one</em> man well?
And verily, a woman need know but one man, in
order to understand <em>all</em> men; whereas a man may
know all women and understand not one of them.</p>

<p>For men are of but one pattern, whereof thou needest
but to discover the secret combination; but
women are as the <em>Yale lock</em>&mdash;no two of them are
alike.</p>

<p>Lo! What a paradox is man&mdash;even a puzzle which
worketh backward!</p>

<p>He mistaketh a sweet scent for a sweet disposition,
and a subtile sachet for a subtile mind.</p>

<p>He voweth, “I admire a discreet woman!”&mdash;and inviteth
the froward blonde of the chorus to supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
He muttereth unto his wife, “Lo! I will go unto the
corner for a cigar”&mdash;and behold, he wandereth unto
many corners and returneth by a circular route.</p>

<p>He kisseth the woman whom he loveth <em>not</em>, and
avoideth her whom he loveth, lest his heart become
entangled. Yea, he seeketh always the wrong
woman that he may forget his heart’s desire.</p>

<p>Yet, whichever he weddeth, he regretteth it all the
days of his life.</p>

<p class="head">BOOK OF HUSBANDS</p>

<h3>CHAPTER ONE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Verily</span>, my Daughter, an husband is a Good
Thing. He giveth the house a “finished”
look, even as a rubber plant and a door-plate.</p>

<p>He suggesteth ready-money, and is an <em>adornment</em>
like unto a potted palm upon the piazza.</p>

<p>When he sitteth beside thee in the tabernacle, he is
as a certificate of respectability; yea in the eyes of
society, he is better than a written recommendation.</p>

<p>Verily, he is as necessary unto thy dinner table as
a centerpiece, and more impressive than cut flowers
and a butler in livery.</p>

<p>When he taketh thee abroad to dine, the waiter shall
not lead thee into dim and draughty corners, but
shall run nimbly and place thee in a choice spot
within <em>hearing</em> of the music.</p>

<p>For a lone woman in a great restaurant looketh pitiful;
but an husband looketh like a real <em>tip</em>.</p>

<p>When thou goest unto an hotel in his company, the
clerk shall not offer thee a room upon the air-shaft;
and the bell-boys shall answer thy ring with flying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
feet and a glad smile. For an husband is as good as
much credit.</p>

<p>Yea, when thou goest forth to shop, saying “Send
this thing to <em>Mrs.</em> Jones”, the clerk shall treat thee
<em>almost</em> as an equal.</p>

<p>Women shall not gossip about thee, and men shall
come unto thy teas with an easy mind, knowing thou
canst have no designs upon them. Thy family shall
call thee “<em>settled</em>”, and no woman shall call thee
“Poor Thing!”</p>

<p>Therefore, I say unto thee, if thou findest thine husband
less them thine ideal, weep not, but be of good
cheer.</p>

<p>For what profiteth it a woman, though she have
every other luxury in all the world, and have not a
<em>little husband</em> in her home?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A</span> perfect husband, who can find one?</p>

<p>For his price is far above gold bonds.</p>

<p>The heart of his wife rejoiceth in him, and
he shall have no lack of encouragement.</p>

<p>He worketh willingly with his hands and bringeth
home <em>all</em> his shekels.</p>

<p>He riseth without calling and lifteth the ice from
off the dumbwaiter. He starteth the kitchen range.
He considereth his wife, and kisseth her <em>occasionally</em>.</p>

<p>Six days of the week doth he labor for his moneys,
and upon the seventh doeth chores within the house
for <em>relaxation</em>.</p>

<p>With his own hands he runneth the lawn mower
and washeth the dog.</p>

<p>He layeth his hands to the parlor curtains and putteth
up the portieres.</p>

<p>He hooketh his wife’s dresses up the back, <em>without</em>
mutterings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
He putteth the cat out by night.</p>

<p>He is <em>not</em> afraid of the cook.</p>

<p>His ashes fall not upon the carpet, and his cigarette
burneth not holes in the draperies.</p>

<p>For he doeth his smoking on the piazza.</p>

<p>He weareth everlasting socks and seweth on his own
buttons.</p>

<p>His overcoat doeth him two seasons.</p>

<p>Yet, when he ventureth abroad with his wife he
donneth a <em>dress suit</em> without grumbling.</p>

<p>The grouch knoweth him not and his breakfast
always pleaseth him. His mouth is filled with
praises for his wife’s cooking. He doth <em>not</em> expect
chicken salad from left-over veal, neither the making
of lobster patties from an ham-bone.</p>

<p>His wife is known within the gates, when she sitteth
among the officers of her Club, by the fit of her
gowns and her imported hats. He luncheth meagrely
upon a sandwich that he may adorn her with fine
jewels. He grumbleth not at the bills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
He openeth his mouth with praises and <em>noteth</em> her
new frock. And the word of flattery is on his tongue.</p>

<p>He perceiveth not the existence of <em>other</em> women.</p>

<p>He may be <em>trusted</em> to mail a letter.</p>

<p>Lo, many men have I met in the world, but none
like unto <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>Yet have ye all seen him&mdash;in your <em>dreams</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Behold</span>, my Daughter, the Lord maketh a
man&mdash;but the <em>wife</em> maketh an <em>husband</em>.</p>

<p>For Man is but the raw material whereon a
woman putteth the <em>finishing touches</em>.</p>

<p>Yea, and whatsoever pattern of husband thou selectest,
thou shalt find him like unto a shop-made
garment, which must be trimmed over and cut down,
and ironed out, and built up to fit the matrimonial
situation.</p>

<p>Verily, the best of husbands hath many raw edges,
and many unnecessary pleats in his temper, and
many wrinkles in his disposition, which must be
removed.</p>

<p>Lo, I charge thee, be wary in thy choice. For, many
shall call, but few shall propose. And, a wise damsel
shall with difficulty select that which fitteth her disposition
and matcheth her tastes&mdash;even that which
shall not pinch upon the bank account, neither
stretch upon the truth, neither shrink nor run nor
fade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
At the second-hand counter thou shalt find many
widowers, which have been remodelled by another
hand. And these are easy to acquire. Yet an hand-me-down
may have been spoiled in the making, and
become frayed at the edges of the temper, and shiny
on the seamy-side.</p>

<p>But a <em>bachelor</em> who hath passed forty is a <em>remnant</em>;
and there is no good material left in him. His sentiments
are moth-eaten and his tender speeches shop-worn.
His manners shall require much basting and
his morals many patches. The gloss hath been
rubbed off his illusions and the color hath gone out
of his emotions. Yet, a clever damsel shall, peradventure,
take one of these and remodel him to seem
as new.</p>

<p>For the happiest wife is not she that getteth the best
husband, but she that maketh the best of that which
she getteth. Verily, verily, an husband is a <em>work of
art</em> which must be executed by hand; for there is no
factory which turneth them out to order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Go</span> to the <em>lemon grove</em>, oh, thou Scholarette!
For no woman with <em>brains</em> hath ever plucked
a peach in the Garden of Matrimony.</p>

<p>Nay, it is not given unto one woman to possess both
real ability and a real husband.</p>

<p>For unto a successful woman an husband is but an
adjunct; and no man yearneth to be an <em>annex</em>!</p>

<p>Alas! He preferreth soft, sweet things, and unto
him a woman that knoweth her own mind is an
abomination.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, a woman with <em>nerves</em> affecteth a man
as a mosquito that buzzeth throughout a summer
night. She wearieth him.</p>

<p>But a woman with <em>nerve</em> is as a cold bath on a winter
morning. She shocketh him!</p>

<p>Lo, an intelligent <em>opinion</em> in the mouth of a woman
horrifieth a man even as the scissors in the mouth
of a babe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
And a wife with <em>judgment</em> which exceedeth his own
is more uncanny than a pet parrot which saith the
appropriate thing at the right moment. She appalleth
him!</p>

<p>My Daughter, in all the land dost thou know of one
clever woman who hath been happily married?</p>

<p>Nay! For I say unto thee there can be but one
mind, one opinion, and one <em>throne</em> in an household;
and every man claimeth these for himself.</p>

<p>Then, oh, thou Temperamental One, whatsoever
thou receivest in the <em>love game</em>, accept it gladly and
rejoice thereat.</p>

<p>For, whether it be a babe torn from the cradle or an
octogenarian spared from the grave; whether it be
a left-over bachelor, or an hand-me-down widower;
though thou weddest fourscore times, thou shalt do
<em>no better</em>!</p>

<p>Verily, verily, in the life of every woman, there
cometh a season when she yearneth for <em>sentiment</em>,
and neither the love of her “art” nor the adoration
of a poodle dog is sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
And a little unhappiness <em>with</em> an husband is more to
be desired than great loneliness <em>without</em> one.</p>

<p>Go to! Life without one of these is as spaghetti
without sauce and more insipid than bouillon without
salt.</p>

<p>Therefore, my Daughter, gather in the Lemon which
Fate awardeth thee and let thine heart be comforted.</p>

<p>For though wine is desirable, yet lemonade is not to

husband an agreeable distraction from <em>serious</em>
things!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">How</span> long, oh thou Credulous One, wilt thou
continue to marry for a <em>change</em>; and the
lawyers delight in their fees, and the neighbors
in their “I-said-so’s”?</p>

<p>For lo, though there be many varieties of men, there
is but <em>one</em> kind of husband!</p>

<p>Yea, though a man wed seven times seven times, he
maketh not the <em>same</em> mistake twice.</p>

<p>But the woman who weddeth a second time, <em>repeateth</em>
her own history.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, if thou wilt but close thine eyes, thou
canst not perceive from his words, neither from the
cloves upon his breath, nor the ardor of his greeting,
whether it be thy <em>first</em> or thy <em>second</em> husband, that
kisseth thee.</p>

<p>For one man’s chin is as rough as another’s, and one
man’s lies are as smooth as another’s.</p>

<p>One man’s razor is as sacred as another’s, and one
man’s excuses are as old as another’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
One man roareth, like unto another, when he is
hungry.</p>

<p>One man growleth, like unto another, when he is
fed.</p>

<p>One man groaneth, like unto another, when he hath
over-eaten.</p>

<p>One man looketh as uncanny as another without a
collar, and as weird as another without a shave.</p>

<p>One man streweth his cigar ashes upon the carpet,
and leaveth his stubs in the pin-tray, even as
another.</p>

<p>One man burieth himself in the pillows in the morning,
and in the newspapers in the evening, and refuseth
to be torn therefrom&mdash;even as another.</p>

<p>One man offereth up the morning and evening
growl, and celebrateth the Sunday forenoon grouch
as regularly as another.</p>

<p>Why, then, wilt thou continue to hearken unto their
promises? For, before marriage, <em>all</em> men are <em>promising</em>;
but matrimony is a chemical which transmuteth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
each and every one of them from a lover into a
critic, from an admirer into a scoffer, from an adorer
into a judge, and from a slave into a sultan.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, there is this difference only in husbands:</p>

<p>That the first maketh thee weep;</p>

<p>The second maketh thee wonder;</p>

<p>But the third maketh thee weary!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER ONE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Lo</span>! wondrous are the workings of a man’s
heart, my Daughter.</p>

<p>His love is a thing which riseth and falleth
as the stock market; yea, like a football that goeth
up, it descendeth swiftly.</p>

<p>Behold, when a man first meeteth a damsel, she
pleaseth his eyes. Moreover, she is different from
the girl <em>before</em> and affordeth a pleasant change. He
adoreth her from afar and indulgeth in foolish pipe-dreams.
He investeth in new cravats and is particular
concerning his collars.</p>

<p>He calleth at first, timidly; he getteth on the good
side of the family. He bringeth burnt offerings of
expensive flowers and sweets from Huyler’s. He
readeth the Rubáiyát unto her and inviteth her to
meet his <em>sister</em>.</p>

<p>And, behold, there cometh a day when he kisseth
her suddenly and without warning.</p>

<p>And another when he kisseth her again&mdash;easily.</p>

<p>And another when he kisseth her much and often.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
And another when he kisseth her more casually.</p>

<p>And another when he departeth early, and kisseth
her but once&mdash;“Good night”.</p>

<p>And another when he <em>faileth</em> to call.</p>

<p>Then, peradventure, she writeth him a letter&mdash;which
he putteth in his pocket and forgetteth to answer.
She summoneth him over the telephone and he goeth
into the booth wearily. She reproacheth and revileth
him. He picketh a quarrel.</p>

<p>She sobbeth “All is over between us!” He answereth
“Oh, very well! Even as thou sayest!”</p>

<p>And, in time, he meeteth another damsel and doeth
it <em>all over again</em>. Yea, the selfsame programme he
repeateth unto the letter; yet, he <em>never</em> tireth.</p>

<p>For lo! though a man hath eaten his fill at one meal,
why shall he lack appetite for the next?</p>

<p>Then, I charge thee, my Daughter, when love beginneth,
question not any man how it will end; for
it is only in the <em>beginning</em> of things that a man is interested;
even in the cream from off the jug, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
bubble of the champagne, the meat on the peach,
and&mdash;the <em>first kiss</em> of a woman.</p>

<p>Yet, what mattereth the end? Is not the end of the
cream, skimmed milk; and the end of a cigar, a stub;
and the end of a peach, a stone; and the end of
champagne, dregs; and the end of love, a quarrel?
And which of these would ye choose?</p>

<p>Verily, the flirtations of a man’s bachelor days are,
in passing, as the courses of the love-feast; but
a <em>wife</em> is the black coffee which <em>settleth</em> him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Marvellous</span>, oh, my Daughter, is the
way of a man with women; for every man
hath a <em>method</em> and each his favorite <em>stunt</em>.
And the stunt that he hath found to work successfully
with one damsel shall be practised upon each
in turn, even unto the finest details thereof.</p>

<p>Behold, one man shall come unto thee saying:</p>

<p>“How foolish are the sentimentalists! But, as for
<em>me</em>, my motives are altruistic and disinterested; and
a woman’s <em>friendship</em> is what I most desire.” Yet, I
charge thee, seek among his women “friends” and
thou shalt not find an <em>homely</em> damsel in all their
number.</p>

<p>For this is the <em>platonic</em> stunt.</p>

<p>Now, another shall try thee by a simpler method.</p>

<p>Lo, suddenly and without warning, he shall arise
and catch thee in his arms. And when thou smitest
him upon the cheek, he shall be overcome with
humiliation, crying:</p>

<p>“I could not <em>help</em> it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Yet be not persuaded, but put him <em>down</em> without
mercy, lest peradventure, he kiss thee again.</p>

<p>For this is the <em>impetuous</em> stunt.</p>

<p>Yet observe how still another seeketh to be more
subtile.</p>

<p>Mark how he sitteth afar off and talketh of love in
the <em>abstract</em>; how he calleth three times a week, yet
remaineth always <em>impersonal</em>; how he praiseth the
shape of thine hand and admireth thy rings, yet
toucheth not so much as the <em>tips</em> of thy fingers.</p>

<p>“Lo,” he thinketh in his heart, “I shall keep her
guessing. Yea, I shall wrack her soul with thoughts
of how I may be brought to subjection. And when
she can no longer contain her curiosity, then will
she seek to <em>lure</em> me, and I shall gather her in mine
arms.”</p>

<p>And this is the <em>elusive</em> stunt.</p>

<p>But, I say unto thee, my Daughter, each of these is
but as a chainstitch unto a rose pattern, beside him
that playeth the <em>frankly devoted</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
For all women are unto him as one woman&mdash;and
that one <em>putty</em>.</p>

<p>Lo, the look of “adoration” in his eyes is like unto
the curl in his hair, <em>always</em> there; and he weareth his
“protecting manner” as naturally and as constantly
as his linen collar.</p>

<p>He is <em>so</em> attentive and the <em>thoughtful thing</em> cometh
unto him as second nature.</p>

<p>Yea, though there be twenty damsels in the room,
yet shall each be made to think in her heart:</p>

<p>“Lo, I am <em>it</em>!”</p>

<p>Verily, verily, all the days of his life he shall be
waited on and cooed over and coddled by women;
and his way shall be as one continuous path of conquests
and thornless roses.</p>

<p>For this is the Stunt of <em>Stunts</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I charge</span> thee, my Daughter, seek not to break
a man’s heart; for it is like unto family pride,
or a pin, which may be <em>bent</em>, but <em>cannot</em> be
broken! Yea, it is as a ball of India rubber which
reboundeth easily after the worst shocks.</p>

<p>Lo, the heart of a woman is full of soft spots in
which every man she hath <em>once</em> loved occupieth a
“cozy corner”. She lingereth tenderly over the grave
of a dead love; but a man flingeth a spadeful of earth
thereon and proceedeth to dig a <em>new</em> one. And his
heart is as a great cemetery!</p>

<p>A woman keepeth a bundle of love-letters tied in
faded ribbons; but a man cleaneth his pipe bowl
cheerfully with the stem of the rose which the
<em>girl-before-the-last</em> hath worn in her hair.</p>

<p>A woman remembereth the dress she hath worn and
the song she hath sung for each particular man; but
a man remembereth not the scent of violet sachet
when the odor of heliotrope is in his nostrils.</p>

<p>And, after <em>six</em> months, when he cometh by chance
upon an old glove or a lock of hair at the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
his trunk, he casteth it into the fire, muttering,
“Now, who the devil put <em>that</em> thing there?”</p>

<p>A woman recollecteth each pet name by which she
hath been called; she alloweth no <em>two</em> men to label
her alike. But unto a man, <em>every</em> woman becometh
in turn “Little Girl” or “Baby” or “Honey”.</p>

<p>Lo, he is as one that playeth with skulls and sporteth
with the bones of his ancestors; for he holdeth
nothing sacred.</p>

<p>He eraseth one face from the tablet of memory, and
draweth another across it.</p>

<p>He changeth his object of thought as readily as he
changeth his clothes and his political opinions.</p>

<p>For a woman’s love is a slow flame which smouldereth
always, but a man’s love is like unto a skyrocket,
which sputtereth out and cannot be rekindled.</p>

<p>Verily, his “past” is always <em>quite</em> past, and his dead
loves are quite dead. And there is <em>nothing</em> which is
more wearisome unto him than the memory of yesterday’s
wine, or yesterday’s flirtation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> Daughter, there are many styles of kisses,
and they come in endless patterns, even as
Oriental rugs.</p>

<p>There is the kiss that sootheth and the kiss that
thrilleth, the kiss that flattereth and the kiss that is a
pastime. But the best of all kisses is the <em>first</em> kiss;
for it is the most difficult.</p>

<p>Yet, in all the days of thy life, no two men shall kiss
thee <em>alike</em>. For one man shall regard thy kisses as a
boon, and another shall regard them as an amusement;
but an husband shall consider them, as the
shaving of his chin, a morning duty.</p>

<p>Hast thou scorned a man’s kisses?</p>

<p>Then will he exalt thee, saying “Lo! she is <em>very</em>
proper.” For he can think of no <em>other</em> reason why
thou shouldst not desire to kiss him.</p>

<p>Yet if thou hast consented to kiss only <em>one</em> man,
he will say unto himself, “Verily, it is her habit.
So doeth she with <em>all</em> mankind.” For every man
judgeth thee by the way in which thou treatest
<em>him</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
If a man kisseth thy hand gracefully, beware of him;
for this is the habit of an accomplished flirt, which
hath been acquired by much practice.</p>

<p>But if he kisseth thee first upon the forehead, and
then upon the eyelids, and then upon the lips, thou
mayest choose thy wedding gown and decide upon
thy bridesmaids.</p>

<p>Lo, kissing is a fine art, and there are many artists;
and one shall take a kiss from thee as though he
doeth thee a favor, and another shall take a kiss as
though he had taken thy pocketbook.</p>

<p>Yet, no man shall ever understand why thou seemest
pleased, or why thou waxest wroth, when he kisseth
thee; for it is all in the <em>way</em> of his wooing.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, a man who kisseth a woman with his
<em>hat</em> on shall be annihilated.</p>

<p>But he, that kisseth her as though he had <em>never</em>
kissed <em>before</em> and never should kiss <em>again</em>, shall wear
an halo in her sight. For he knoweth the Art of
<em>Arts</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Lo</span>, my Daughter, a man came unto me saying:</p>

<p>“Let me be thy slave. For, behold, I am
<em>all devotion</em>. And it is my delight to serve a fair
woman.”</p>

<p>And I looked at him and smiled sadly.</p>

<p>For I knew that he was <em>invulnerable</em>; and all my
weapons were broken against me.</p>

<p>But another came unto me saying:</p>

<p>“Behold! I am a <em>woman-hater</em>. Not one of them do
I trust. Nay, not one can deceive and allure me. For
I have <em>their numbers</em>, all of them.”</p>

<p>And my heart was gladdened. For, by that sign, I
knew that he was <em>easy</em>. And my way was clear before
me.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, men are of three varieties: the kind
that must be driven with whip and spur; the kind
that must be coaxed with apples and sugar; and the
kind that must be blindfolded and <em>backed</em> into the
shafts of matrimony.</p>

<p>And the woman-hater is like unto the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Therefore, I charge thee, when thou meetest one of
these seek not to argue with him, neither to convince
him; but <em>agree</em> with him sweetly, that all thy sex is
weak and untrustworthy.</p>

<p>Discourse sorrowfully upon the <em>pitfalls</em> of flirtation,
and the <em>hollowness</em> of love, and the <em>horrors</em> of matrimony.</p>

<p>Declare boldly thy scorn for the New Woman, and
for the Old Woman, and for the Frivolous Woman,
and for the Highbrow, and for the Lowbrow, and all
the women that are on the earth and in the heavens
above the earth.</p>

<p>And when thou hast disarmed him, taking all his
arguments from out his mouth, speak sweetly concerning
the beauties of <em>platonic friendship</em> and wax
rapturous in its praises.</p>

<p>Bring the cushion for his head, and the footstool for
his feet, and feed him from the chafing dish with the
fruits of thine own cooking, saying:</p>

<p>“I prithee, <em>do</em> smoke, for it is so <em>chummy</em>! Yea, I
beg of thee, treat me as thou wouldst a <em>man</em> friend.”</p>

<p>Let him hold thy hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
And he shall say in his heart:</p>

<p>“Would to heaven I were not a Woman Hater, and
that all women were like unto her; for she is <em>sensible</em>
and <em>sincere</em>&mdash;and a bachelor flat was never like <em>this</em>!”</p>

<p>And upon the seventh evening he shall fall down
before thee and retract all his words, eating them
one by one.</p>

<p>And when thou remindest him of thy warnings and
of thy fear of marriage, he will seek to persuade
thee and will comfort thee with kisses and a solitaire.</p>

<p>Then shalt thou slip the bridle over his head and the
reins shall be in <em>thine</em> hands. And there shall be <em>one
less</em> Woman Hater in the world.</p>

<p>For a <em>Woman Hater</em>, my Beloved, is like unto the
simple ostrich, which hideth its head in the sand and
thinketh itself safe.</p>

<p>But he that professeth open adoration is like unto
the park squirrel, which will eat out of thine hand
but can <em>never be caught</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER SIX</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> Daughter, a woman is a study in moods
and tenses, but man is a simple proposition
which worketh according to a
“system”.</p>

<p>Behold, how the two regard a letter. For when a
woman writeth she spelleth her soul out on paper;
but a man putteth all his <em>tender</em> meanings between
the lines. Yea, a woman’s letter is a confession, but
a man’s letter is a veiled allusion which <em>concealeth</em>
his thoughts. Verily, it is a work of <em>art</em>.</p>

<p>Yet, when a woman receiveth it, she readeth it over
many times, and placeth it within her shirtwaist by
day, and under her pillow by night. For she knoweth
that, with temptations like unto telephones and
post-cards within reach, a <em>hand-written letter</em> is a
sign of devotion.</p>

<p>But, when a man receiveth a woman’s letter, he
droppeth it in his pocket. Nay, not in the pocket
above his heart, but in that pocket which containeth
the fewest bills and receipts and lead pencils and
other <em>valuable</em> things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
He carryeth it there faithfully&mdash;until he changeth
his coat.</p>

<p>He layeth it away in an unused drawer amongst
other trash.</p>

<p>He forgetteth it.</p>

<p>And, when years shall have passed, he findeth it and
taketh it out curiously.</p>

<p>He regardeth it with astonishment.</p>

<p>He wrinkleth his brows with his great effort at recollection,
saying: “Now who the dickens wrote
this thing? Yea, <em>who</em> is ‘Mabel’?”</p>

<p>He giveth it up.</p>

<p>And lo! he proceedeth to make pipe-lighters of thine
heart-to-heart effusion.</p>

<p>Behold thy letter, like unto his love, goeth up in
smoke!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER ONE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Give</span> ear, my Daughter, and receive my wisdom,
for the <em>husband-hunt</em> leadeth over many
hurdles and the trail of the Eligible Thing
aboundeth in pitfalls.</p>

<p>Lo, the woods are full of men, but men are full of
strange suspicions; and in elusiveness the fox is
simple beside them.</p>

<p>I charge thee, seek not to be a fashion-plate; for a
human “shriek” giveth warning and affrighteth the
game. Verily a <em>becoming</em> frock of home manufacture
is more to be desired than a French creation which
maketh thee to resemble a bad dream!</p>

<p>Costly thy smile as thy dentist shall make it; for a
pearl in the mouth exceedeth two on the finger.
And it is better to be dead than <em>unkissable.</em></p>

<p>Cheap thy gloves, if need be, but expensive thy
sachet; for a man knoweth not scent from sentiment.</p>

<p>Few thy rings, but many thy bangles; for a musical
jingle fascinateth him even as the sound of a rattle
fascinateth a babe. Yea, manicured nails and <em>perfectly</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
clean cuffs are more to be desired in the world
of business than a knowledge of stenography. Modest
thy hats, yet chic withal; and thy hair glorious.
For a <em>cheap coiffure</em> is an abomination, but a made-to-order
switch is a woman’s “crown of beauty”.</p>

<p>Look not upon the rouge-pot when it is <em>too</em> red, but
delicate thy blushes and thy complexion put on with
a fine brush and self-restraint.</p>

<p>Plain thy coat, but frilly thy petticoat and of all silk;
for a feminine “swish” is as poetry unto the masculine
ear.</p>

<p>Then, I say unto thee, waste not thy substance upon
style. For a man knoweth not last year’s left-over
from this year’s fad, but he knoweth a “vision” when
he seeth her.</p>

<p>Verily, a wise virgin hideth her light under a bushel
of simplicity, but a foolish damsel goeth forth resembling
a human snare. She painteth her cheek
as with house paint, and gildeth her hair with much
gold. She adorneth herself with feathers and weareth
dangling ear-rings. And at sight of her men fly
on wings of fear.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">How</span> little, O, my Daughter, how exceeding
little shall satisfy the heart of a woman!</p>

<p>For a man’s love is like unto an orchid,
which requireth tender persuasion and <em>constant cultivation</em>.
But a woman’s love is like unto an air
plant, which flourisheth continually upon <em>imagination</em>.</p>

<p>Now, I knew a damsel of Babylon, and she was exceeding
fair, having dove’s eyes, and curling locks,
and much moneys, and a motor car.</p>

<p>Wherefore the youths of the land flocked unto her
house, and her parlor was always <em>full</em>, and her piazza
running over.</p>

<p>And one of these was a medal-winner, called Clod,
who possessed a football figure and a Gibson profile.
But the least among them all was Wisenheimer, who
was abbreviated and whose hair was thin upon the
top.</p>

<p>And Clod come unto the damsel, bringing his medals
and his loving cups and divers trophies. And when
he had shown them all and had told her of his deeds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
of prowess, he sat afar off in a corner and conversed
of <em>generalities</em> and of <em>himself</em>.</p>

<p>For he said in his heart, “When she hath seen what
great works I am destined to accomplish, then will
she gladly share them with me and shine in my reflected
glory.”</p>

<p>But Wisenheimer concentrated all his conversation
upon <em>one topic</em>, saying:</p>

<p>“How marvellous are thine eyes to-night, O Star
of Beauty! And thy lips have a curve like unto the
smile of Mona Lisa. Thy hair is of a wonderful softness;
and <em>what</em> is that fascinating perfume thou
usest? Lo, many damsels have I known, but thou
excellest them all; for thou art as Maxine Elliot and
Lillian Russell and the Venus de Milo in one!”</p>

<p>And the damsel was interested, and she said:</p>

<p>“Go on!”</p>

<p>Then Wisenheimer cast himself before her crying:
“Lo, what am I, a worm and a parasite, that I should
aspire to thy love?</p>

<p>“Behold, I am a <em>sinner</em> and full of <em>evil</em>, yet I need the
love of a <em>noble woman</em> to save me! I am as <em>nothing</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and have accomplished nothing, yet I yearn for the
inspiration of an angel to guide me and sustain me
and spur me on to higher things!”</p>

<p>And lo, the maiden fell upon his neck and comforted
him with kisses and with promises. And the wedding
was set for October.</p>

<p>Yet all her friends said:</p>

<p>“What doth she see in <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>But I say unto thee, the maiden was wise. For
verily, verily, in the comedy of matrimony there is
more joy in being a <em>star</em> than in being an <em>understudy</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Behold</span>, my Daughter, how Man’s taste concerning
women hath changed!</p>

<p>For lo, it hath come to pass that a maiden of
sweet and simple sixteen is, unto a matron of fair
and frivolous forty, as breakfast food unto caviar
and old wine.</p>

<p>Yea, a man no longer yearneth for a babe to cuddle;
and a clinging vine fretteth him, as a shoe that
squeaketh or a chair that wobbleth. Moreover, he
desireth <em>rich</em> things. And a widow with many shekels
hath a more solid attraction than a damsel with
naught but beauties of the soul.</p>

<p>Go to! The kiss of a damsel of sixteen is more insipid
than pink ice-cream, but the kiss of a woman
of forty hath the flavor of experience and vera
violetta.</p>

<p>Lo, a damsel worshippeth a man as a demi-god and
discourseth unto him of her “ideals”; but a matron
<em>mothereth</em> him and cooeth unto him in <em>baby talk</em>. A
damsel discusseth the <em>weather</em> with a youth and
singeth “The Rosary” unto him; but a woman of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
forty discusseth <em>his talents</em> and singeth him lullabies.
A maiden babbleth on as the brook, thinking to be
<em>always</em> amusing, but a matron knoweth that after
his labors of the day a man preferreth a down pillow
unto fireworks.</p>

<p>A maiden pouteth and chafeth beneath his “moods”,
but a matron ascertained whether they proceed
from indigestion or an ingrowing temperament, and
healeth them accordingly with soda mints or flattery.</p>

<p>A maiden seeketh to appear <em>mysterious</em>, and romantic,
but a matron playeth always the <em>platonic friend</em>.
She is <em>so</em> simple.</p>

<p>A maiden goeth roundabout ways to hasten a proposal,
but a matron <em>seemeth to put it off</em>. She forbiddeth
him to speak of marriage, even as she forbiddeth
a small boy to touch the medicine which she
hath determined he shall swallow. And lo, he yearneth
straightway therefor.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, a maiden goeth forth with the sound
of bugles and an airgun, but a matron setteth her
trap in unseen places and lieth low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
A maiden <em>challengeth</em> a man with coquettishness,
but a matron putteth him to <em>sleep</em>! For no man
goeth into matrimony with his eyes open! Verily,
verily, he falleth in love as he falleth out of bed, and
awakeneth with a great shock, knowing not <em>how it
hath happened</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Hast</span> thou heard the tale of the wise and
foolish virgins, oh, my Daughter? Then
hearken! For this parable pointeth a great
moral.</p>

<p>Now, the foolish virgin cried unto her sisters, early
in the season, “Lo! the spirit of the love-chase is
upon me! I must be up and doing. For the summer
resort shall be my happy hunting ground, where the
game is easy and plentiful.”</p>

<p>And she went her ways rejoicing, armed with three
trunks and a pink parasol and girded about with
lingerie frocks and a silk bathing suit.</p>

<p>Yet, when she had arrived upon the scene, behold
there was naught within sight! Lo, each morning
she wandered upon the beach with one callow college-youth
and each evening danced gladly with a
flirtatious octogenarian. All the damsels of the
hotel, they waltzed in pairs and <em>pretended</em> to like it!</p>

<p>But the wise virgin sighed, “Alas! I cannot <em>afford</em>
to go upon a vacation trip. Nay I must stay in town!
For I shall be <em>busy</em>.”</p>

<p>And she <em>was</em> busy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
For, when all the other women had departed, the
men of the town, being much bored and having
naught else to do, flocked unto her door and made
themselves comfortable upon her piazza.</p>

<p>Yea, in twos and threes came they, the simple youth
with his mandolin and the wise youth with his
Rubáiyát, the married man in his loneliness, and the
bachelor whose sweetheart was abroad.</p>

<p>And she fed them iced drinks and flattery, and they
absorbed all of it gladly&mdash;and were consoled!</p>

<p>And lo, before the summer had waned she wore six
engagement rings; for the harvest was plentiful.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, a summer resort is a place wherein a
woman will resort to anything, from a babe unto a
grandfather, for amusement; but a womanless town
is a ripe field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER SIX</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Oh</span>, ye damsels of Babylon! Ye followers after
fads and wearers of pearl earrings! How
long will ye seek to appear <em>sophisticated</em>?
How long will ye continue to pose as <em>cynics</em>, and
think it chic to be satirical and piquant to be capricious?</p>

<p>Know ye not, oh foolish ones, that a man dreadeth a
female cynic as a small boy dreadeth an education?
Yea, and a satirical damsel is unto him as a caterpillar
upon the neck, which maketh him to shudder.
But a capricious woman is as gravel in the shoes.
She giveth him great <em>pain</em>.</p>

<p>Behold, a foolish damsel seeketh always to scintillate.
She appeareth clothed in worldly wisdom
and bristling with opinions. She provoketh arguments
and answereth with repartee. She mocketh
at a man’s sentiments and rebuketh him with epigrams.
She maketh him to look <em>foolish</em>.</p>

<p>But a wise damsel is sweeter than distilled honey
and more <em>simple</em> than the plot of a Robert Chambers
novel. She lighteth her own way with the sun
of her smiles, and smootheth all her paths with soft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
soap. She seeketh not her own glorification but
poureth oil upon the vanity of the just and unjust
alike.</p>

<p>Doth a youth argue with her, she is easily convinced
and covereth him with approbation, saying: “How
didst thou <em>ever</em> think of <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>And, lo, his argument is broken against him.</p>

<p>Doth her Beloved call at eve, bringing with him the
<em>grouch</em> “that knoweth no brother”, she greeteth him
with the <em>smile</em> that knoweth no sister.</p>

<p>She ministereth unto him with cooling drinks and
looks of sympathy.</p>

<p>She bringeth him the ash-tray and the shaded lamp
and the foot-stool and the newspapers.</p>

<p>She urgeth him to <em>smoke</em>.</p>

<p>She forbeareth to <em>talk</em>.</p>

<p>And behold his mood dissolveth as the mist before
the sun, and he exclaimeth in his heart: “Good
Heavens! What would life <em>be</em> without this <em>woman</em>!”</p>

<p>He proposeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
And all the days of her life she treadeth upon velvet.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, a wise woman preferreth peace of
mind unto her own opinions, <em>comfort</em> unto her dignity,
and an <em>husband</em> unto a reputation for brilliancy.
She saith in her heart:</p>

<p>“I am not here to <em>reform</em> him, but to <em>please</em> him.”</p>

<p>And, lo, all the world is her <em>roller coaster</em>! For the
price of <em>peace</em> is a <em>perpetual smile</em>!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER ONE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Go</span> to, my Daughter. Knowest thou a man
who hath lived long in a bachelor flat? Then
beware of him! For his ways are full of
guile and he hath not a thrill left.</p>

<p>Alas, the bachelor flat is a curse sent upon Woman.
For, lo, though a man hath dwelt in the back hall-room
of a boarding-house for many years and hath
suffered all its untold horrors, the moment he taketh
a flat the sweet feminine thing seeketh him out and
yearneth to make him “comfortable”.</p>

<p>And his days are made sad with sofa pillows and
towel racks, and picture frames, and shaving-pads,
and foot-stools, until his house resembleth a bargain
counter, or the spoils from the harem of a sacked
city.</p>

<p>He groaneth when he seeketh in corners for a spot
wherein to place his forty-seventh cushion; he
curseth when he returneth after dark and falleth
over tabourets and <em>other</em> evidences of the <em>pursuit
of man</em>; he laugheth as he borroweth old socks from
his men friends that he may supply <em>all</em> of those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
desire to do his mending. And to him, in matters of
love, there is nothing new under the sun.</p>

<p>For the man that weddeth a widow is number two,
but the woman that weddeth a bachelor-flatee is
number <em>forty-two</em>.</p>

<p>And when she mendeth his coat and patteth his pillow;
when she kisseth him in the cleft within his
chin and runneth her fingers through his hair, he
feeleth no thrill. For these are unto him but as a
tale that hath been many times told.</p>

<p>Verily, his sentiments are frayed at the edges and
his emotions worn thin with usage. His heart is
patched in many places and his illusions are as last
year’s roses&mdash;withered.</p>

<p>Yea, his love is but as warmed-over pudding or cold
veal served upon the second day; even as second-hand
furniture, whereof the interior is motheaten.</p>

<p>But he is better than <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Verily</span>, verily, my Daughter, the fool hath
said in her heart, “All men should marry!
For there is a reason for everything under
the sun, save a <em>bachelor</em>.”</p>

<p>But I have gone among the bachelors, questioning
them, young and old; and I say unto thee, the
“<em>reasons</em>” why a man taketh a <em>stimulant</em> are not
more numerous and wonderful than the reasons why
he doth not marry.</p>

<p>Behold, he doth not marry:</p>

<p>Because he is too <em>young</em>.</p>

<p>Because he is too <em>old</em>.</p>

<p>Because he hath not <em>thought</em> about it.</p>

<p>Because he hath thought <em>too much</em> about it.</p>

<p>Because he is poor and cannot <em>afford</em> a wife.</p>

<p>Because he is rich and doth not <em>require</em> a wife.</p>

<p>Because he loveth <em>no</em> woman.</p>

<p>Because he loveth <em>all</em> women.</p>

<p>Because he hath not met the <em>right</em> woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Because he <em>hath</em> met the right woman and been
“disappointed”.</p>

<p>Because he hath many <em>illusions</em> concerning women.</p>

<p>Because he hath <em>no</em> illusions concerning them.</p>

<p>Because <em>no</em> woman is good enough.</p>

<p>Because <em>he</em> is not “good enough” for <em>any</em> woman.</p>

<p>Because he is not ready to <em>settle down</em>.</p>

<p>Because he is <em>already</em> settled down, and is content.</p>

<p>Because he is <em>weak</em> and fearful.</p>

<p>Because he is <em>strong</em> and impregnable.</p>

<p>And, likewise&mdash;just <em>because</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Hearken</span>, my Daughter, unto the parable of
the merrie bachelor; hearken and be comforted.</p>

<p>For, I say unto thee, not one of these liveth but shall
receive his just desert!</p>

<p>Now, in my youth, there came unto me such an one,
saying, “<em>Why</em> shall I marry? For lo, have I not <em>all</em>
the comforts of home, at <em>half</em> the expense? Behold,
I have three good meals a day and a den filled with
gew-gaws, which are the work of many damsels.
Yea, and not one of them but yearneth to sew on my
buttons.</p>

<p>“Moreover, I can go forth into the country in the
summer time without having to pawn mine overcoat;
and in the winter I can go unto my club without
having to perjure my soul.</p>

<p>“Verily, verily, my life is like unto an eleven-course
dinner.</p>

<p>“For on Monday I may talk <em>art</em> unto a high-browed
damsel; and on Tuesday I may talk <em>love</em> unto a
widow; and on Wednesday I may talk <em>nonsense</em>
unto a fluffy thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
“But a married man must talk <em>domestic economy</em>
unto the <em>same woman</em> every night, which is like a
table d’hote menu, of a deadening monotony.</p>

<p>“Behold, I offer no apology for my singleness; for
I am <em>unashamed</em>! And my one fear is that I shall
awaken from this <em>dream</em>!”</p>

<p>And I answered him, saying, “Even so!”</p>

<p>Yet, as time passed, the hairs dropped one by one
from the head of the bachelor, until it shone as a
great light.</p>

<p>Lo, from eating and drinking much good food and
having no <em>worries</em>, he became round and pudgy, like
unto a Billiken.</p>

<p>And the maidens of the land who had trembled at his
approach now tittered merrily at sight of him. Yea,
whereas, before, he had been able to spend an whole
evening with one of them, bringing a box of cheap
candy, he now spent all his savings upon them.</p>

<p>For it requireth real orchids and champagne to make
a fat man <em>fascinating</em>.</p>

<p>And he observed the married men of his acquaintance,
that from overworking they had still kept their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
figures and were <em>interesting</em>. Yea, and they flirted
with their stenographers and were merry; but the
bachelor not having to labor had accomplished nothing;
for he had spent his days in yawning.</p>

<p>Then he came unto me, crying:</p>

<p>“Lo! At last I would marry and settle down. But
she that I once loved hath married another. And
how shall I choose a wife? For all women are as
<em>one</em> woman unto me.”</p>

<p>And I mocked him with my ha-has, saying:</p>

<p>“My Son, I adjure thee, wed any woman thou
<em>canst</em>! For the buds of the Nation are <em>not</em> collecting
antiques. Yet, peradventure, one of these shall accept
thee as a <em>good thing</em>; or another shall take thee
as a <em>last resort</em>, when she hath passed her fifth
season. Go to! Thou hast eaten the bread of life
without <em>honey</em> thereon, and thou shalt hereafter be
satisfied with the <em>crumbs</em>.”</p>

<p>Verily, verily, life without love is as a pipe without
a light; but a man without a wife is as a helpless
barge without a tow-boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> Daughter, hear now the Thanksgiving
Day prayer of a bachelor:</p>

<p>Oh, Lord, I thank Thee that Thou hast
vouchsafed me another year of <em>freedom</em>. That I am
still safe!</p>

<p>That Thou hast made me what I <em>am</em>&mdash;wise, unconquerable,
immune!</p>

<p>That, although I have many times lost my heart, I
have never yet lost my <em>head</em>.</p>

<p>That I did not marry my first love.</p>

<p>That, though the hairs of my head be numbered,
they are still sufficient to cover my bald spot.</p>

<p>That, though my forehead gradually becometh more
<em>intellectual</em>, it is not yet bare.</p>

<p>That I have never yet written a letter which could
be held against me in a breach-of-promise suit, but
have confined all my <em>tender</em> messages unto telegrams
and postcards.</p>

<p>That all my words have been discreet and mine actions
cautious and self-restrained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
That, although maidens may bestow upon me purple
neckties, spotted scarfs, plaid mufflers and orange-colored
gloves at Christmastide, I shall not be required
to <em>wear</em> them.</p>

<p>That I am still regarded as <em>eligible</em> among maidens
and matrons. That they have not <em>found me out</em>!</p>

<p>That, day by day, my heart is acquiring a coat of
cement and my conscience a coat of mail.</p>

<p>That I have carefully preserved all my emotions in
alcohol!</p>

<p>That there is no marrying nor giving in marriage in
Heaven!</p>

<p>Yea, for good cigars, bachelor flats, vaudeville, briar
pipes, clubs, apartment hotels, stenographers, comic
operas, taxicabs and <em>widows</em>, Good Lord I thank
Thee!</p>

<p>And now in the name of peace and contentment,
vouchsafe me another year of single blessedness.</p>

<p>Yea, give me liberty or give me death! Amen!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER ONE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Behold</span>, my Daughter, I have parted from
mine Appendix and my conscience is clear!
Therefore do I fear but three things in all
the world:</p>

<p>And the first of these is a mouse.</p>

<p>And the second is embonpoint.</p>

<p>But the third is a <em>Trained Nurse</em>!</p>

<p>For I have watched her at her <em>work</em>.</p>

<p>And, I charge thee, in the flutter of her apron there
lurketh more danger than in the whole chorus of a
comic opera. For a chorus girl practiseth her wiles
upon strong men, but <em>she</em> seeketh him only that is
stricken and at her mercy.</p>

<p>Yea, when he is down-and-out she getteth in her
fine work.</p>

<p>Upon her head she weareth a cute cap, which glorifieth
her as a halo in his sight. She walketh upon
heels of velvet and cooeth unto him in a voice of
silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Her smile runneth over and will <em>not</em> come off.</p>

<p>She hath dove’s eyes.</p>

<p>She batheth his brow with spikenard and myrrh, and
anointeth him with alcohol. She arrangeth his pillows
and comforteth his soul with words of cheer.
<em>She taketh his pulse!</em></p>

<p>He yearneth to be babied&mdash;and she babyeth him.</p>

<p>He pineth for sympathy&mdash;and she sympathizeth.</p>

<p>He seeketh comfort&mdash;and she maketh him <em>comfortable</em>.</p>

<p>And <em>what</em> chance hath a damsel at a pink tea beside
a ministering angel such as one of these?</p>

<p>Go to, thou Simple One! What strength is there in
a <em>sick</em> man that he shall flee before all the temptations
of St. Anthony, in one?</p>

<p>Nay, though he be of stone and of adamant, though
his heart be encased in barbed wire, yet shall he turn
upon his pillow sighing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
“Alas Miriam is all right; but a <em>wife</em> was never
like this!”</p>

<p>Yet how guileless is human nature! For, ye will
keep your silver in a strong box and your jewels behind
bars of iron; yet will ye trust your <em>beloved</em> in
the hands of one of these.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, the Lorelei is passeé and witches are
no more.</p>

<p>But a Little Trained Nurse is a <em>dangerous thing</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Verily</span>, my Daughter, there be these three:
the maid, the matron, and the widow; and
the luckiest of these is the <em>widow</em>.</p>

<p>For she hath graduated from the School of Experience
and her crêpe veil glorifieth her as a diploma.</p>

<p>And, though she may live in a bachelor flat, none
shall gossip about her; but whatsoever she doeth
shall seem “cute” in the eyes of men.</p>

<p>When she talketh wittily they shall not say, “She
knoweth too much”; and when she talketh foolishly
they shall declare that she but seeketh to <em>appear</em>
simple. If she smoketh a cigarette, she will make
excuse, saying, “Mine <em>husband</em> taught me how to
do this thing”, and all men shall call her “fascinating”.</p>

<p>Yea, she possesseth all the glory of matrimony, even
unto “Mrs.” on her name, and none of the discomforts.
She shall marry a second time if she so desireth;
and if she doth <em>not</em>, who shall say that she
<em>could</em> not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
For one man hath set his seal of approval upon her,
and where one hath led the rest shall follow like unto
a flock of Geese. Yea, in the matter of women, man
hath great faith in the judgment of his brother, but
he doubteth his <em>own</em> taste.</p>

<p>And, though a widow be neither wealthy, nor good
to look upon; though she be fat and forty and frivolous;
yet she understandeth how to make a man
comfortable&mdash;which is the secret of all wisdom. She
shall feed the lambs from the chafing-dish and the
lions with honeyed words; she shall coax the
smoker to smoke; she shall hold a match to his
cigar; she shall bring a footstool for his feet and a
couch pillow for his head; she shall mend his gloves
and listen eagerly to his stories unto seven times
seven times.</p>

<p>Yet envy her not, my daughter, for hath she not
been married once? And a woman who hath once
<em>been married</em> hath earned whatsoever she receiveth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Heed</span> my instructions, oh my Son, that thou
mayest understand the Seven Poses of
Woman!</p>

<p>For, whether she dwelleth in the high places or in
the low places, her nets are cast into the sea, and
her hooks are bated with perfume and chafing-dishes
and domesticity.</p>

<p>Yea, though she hideth in a studio apartment and
cryeth “I shall never marry!”, yet doth she seek to
lure thee with joss sticks and pink tea and rarebits
and the <em>artistic temperament</em>.</p>

<p>Likewise, beware when she patteth thy coat lapel;
when she slippeth her hand confidingly into thine
overcoat pocket be not persuaded. For the touch of
a damsel’s fingers is alluring, but a <em>wife’s</em> “touch”
is expensive.</p>

<p>Lo, when she mothereth thee; when she runneth her
fingers through thy top hair; when she inquireth
concerning thy health and urgeth thee to wear rubbers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
be prepared to escape her; for, so doth she
shear the lamb for the slaughter.</p>

<p>When her shoe cometh untied, when her side-comb
falleth out, when her hair tumbleth down, in the
game of tennis, turn away thine eyes, lest thou be
undone. For, Circe was as naught, beside a woman
with flowing hair.</p>

<p>When she “turneth” her ankle upon the golf links,
I charge thee do not bear her in thine arms to safety;
but, for thy soul’s sake, flee in search of a doctor,
’ere she turneth thine head also.</p>

<p>When she putteth perfume upon thy locks, oh beware
of her! For she doeth this that she may mark
thee for <em>her own</em>; and, until it be washed away, thou
shalt be covered with shame in the eyes of the
world.</p>

<p>But, when she coaxeth thee to be adorned, when she
seeketh to <em>manicure thy nails</em>; when she patteth thy
fingers and yearneth to bathe them with sweet ointments;
when she weareth a cute apron and sitteth
more near, I charge thee, clasp thine hands behind
thee, crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
“Nay! Thou mayest <em>hold</em> them, but thou shalt <em>not
manicure</em> them!”</p>

<p>For by this strategy fell the Benedicts.</p>

<p>Go to, my Son! Ask me not how I have learned of
Woman, concerning all her <em>poses</em>.</p>

<p>For lo, I am a <em>woman</em>, and I have <em>tried</em> them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> secret musings of thy Father Solomon,

<p>Read now his libellous words, my Daughter, and
ponder thereon; for he hath known <em>much girl</em>:</p>

<p>“Verily, verily, in all the world, there be but two
things which have power to disconcert me.</p>

<p>“A Meerschaum Pipe is one of these.</p>

<p>“The other is <em>a woman</em>.</p>

<p>“And, so like is the first unto the second, that I
doubt not the former is but a reincarnation of the
latter.</p>

<p>“Lo, I have colored upward of twenty meerschaums,
and have made love unto upward of seven hundred
damsels. And I say unto thee, not one of them hath
been worth the struggle nor repaid the toil and
travail.</p>

<p>“Behold, how a man purchaseth a meerschaum at
great price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
“Behold, how he wooeth a woman at great expense.</p>

<p>“How joyfully he flingeth away his shekels that they
may be covered with silver and fine gold!</p>

<p>“How tenderly he encaseth them in velvet!</p>

<p>“With what care and delicacy he wasteth his golden
hours in the coloring of his pipe!</p>

<p>“With what pains and ingenuity he wasteth golden
years in winning the heart of a woman!</p>

<p>“How lovingly he burneth tobacco for the one!</p>

<p>“How patiently he burneth incense before the other!</p>

<p>“Yet, lo, a sudden coldness&mdash;and the pipe hath
snapped! A sudden chilliness&mdash;and the woman’s
love is shattered!</p>

<p>“Or let the fire within the meerschaum’s bowl wax
too hot, or the ardor of his devotion unto the woman
wax too intense&mdash;and behold the pipe is ruined and
the woman is spoiled forever!</p>

<p>“And it is all <em>up</em> with him!</p>

<p>“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘All women are as
trolley cars, which having once been caught, need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
no longer be pursued.’ But I say unto thee, thy pursuing
is never finished; thy task is never done!</p>

<p>“For, seven times seven weeks, mayest thou devote
thyself unto a meerschaum, and seven times seven
months, unto a damsel!</p>

<p>“Yet if thou layest them aside, and thinkest to cease
from thy devotions for but a little while, lo, the pipe
hath faded&mdash;and the woman hath forgotten thee.</p>

<p>“Verily, verily, there is no rest for a peaceful man!
For, life with a pipe, or a woman, is all toil and
travail and vexation.</p>

<p>“Yet life <em>without</em> them is all weariness and desolation!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER ONE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> Daughter, Hearken Unto My Words, And
attend diligently to my counsel; for the
understanding of <em>Man</em> is the beginning of
a good income, and a knowledge of <em>his ways</em> more
profitable than a higher education.</p>

<p>Behold, a woman delighteth to travel the path of
love slowly and through devious by-ways of flirtation
and sentiment, but a man <em>rusheth</em> over it at the
speed limit.</p>

<p>Unto a woman, the first kiss is but the <em>start</em> in the
love chase, but unto a man it is ofttimes the <em>finish</em>.</p>

<p>Lo, when a woman weddeth a man, it is in order that
she may <em>get</em> him; but when a man weddeth a
woman, it is in order that he may prevent <em>another</em>
from getting her.</p>

<p>Yea, verily, when a woman clingeth unto single
blessedness, it is because she hath met <em>no</em> man with
whom she could endure to live; but, when a man
remaineth a bachelor, it is because he hath met no
woman <em>without</em> whom he <em>cannot</em> live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
A man weddeth a woman in order to escape loneliness,
and immediately thereafter joineth a <em>club</em> in
order to escape the woman.</p>

<p>He marryeth a damsel because she appealeth to his
“higher nature”, and spendeth all the rest of his
days seeking after those who appeal to his lower
nature.</p>

<p>A woman is cast down with doubts lest a man doth
not love her; but a man never troubleth his soul, as
to whether or not a woman loveth him, but as to
whether or not he <em>wanteth</em> her to love him.</p>

<p>Behold, an <em>honest</em> woman may cheat at cards, but
never at love; but he considereth himself an “<em>honorable
man</em>” that never cheateth at a game of poker
though he never playeth fair at the game of hearts.</p>

<p>Go to! Think no man <em>in love</em> while he flattereth
thee and extolleth all thy ways; but, when he beginneth
to <em>moralise</em> and to criticise thy <em>hats</em>, then
mayest thou plan thy trousseau.</p>

<p>When he saveth thy life it may be for chivalry’s
sake; but when he carryeth an <em>umbrella</em> to please
thee it is for love’s sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Be not set up when a man giveth thee the key to
his heart, for, peradventure, upon the following day,
he may <em>change the lock</em>!</p>

<p>Then, how shall a woman understand a man, since
they are <em>all</em> cut upon the <em>bias</em>!</p>

<p>Verily, verily, by turning him around, my Daughter,
and reading him <em>backward</em>, even as a Chinese laundry
ticket!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">How</span> long, oh, ye Easy Ones, shall men continue
to call ye “<em>kitten</em>” when they are sentimental
and “<em>cat</em>” when they wax cynical?</p>

<p>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, the ways of a <em>man</em>
are the ways of Grimalkin; for doth not a cat, and
likewise a man, prize his <em>dignity</em> above all things
else in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or
in the subways under the earth?</p>

<p>Moreover, doth not a cat, and likewise a man, seek
out all the <em>soft</em> places upon the face of the earth, and
all the most <em>comfortable</em> spots within the house, and
all the <em>easy</em> chairs of the office?</p>

<p>Yea, doth not a man, even as a cat, wander abroad
at night and return only at mealtimes?</p>

<p>Doth not a cat, and also a man, cling unto the
woman that maketh him most <em>comfortable</em> and
stroketh him the <em>right</em> way, but revile and despise
her that disturbeth his meditations and arouseth him
from his slumbers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Doth not a cat flee in terror from one that flingeth
cold water upon his coat, and a man from her that
flingeth cold water upon his vanity?</p>

<p>Doth not a man, like unto a cat, struggle to escape
when he is held <em>tightly</em>, yet remain cheerfully where
he is not wanted?</p>

<p>Doth not a cat, and likewise a man, flee fearfully
from that which is flung at his head&mdash;whether it be
a bone, or a plate, or a <em>woman</em>?</p>

<p>And, being “dropped,” doth not a cat and likewise
a man, land always upon his <em>feet</em> and depart in
search of consolation?</p>

<p>Lo, if thou pursuest a cat and a man with thine
endearments will they not shrink from thee, with
vexation?</p>

<p>But, if thou ignorest them, will they not sit devotedly
at thy feet?</p>

<p>Go to! I say unto thee a <em>woman</em> is not as a tabby,
but as a Faithful Fido which cannot be shaken off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
She followeth a man whithersoever he goeth, accepting
gladly a pat upon the head and a kind word, and
lying down at his feet to be <em>stepped on</em>.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, why doth a spinster console herself
with a <em>cat</em> in her loneliness?</p>

<p>Even because this is the only thing which can be
found to resemble a <em>man</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Lo</span>, while a man courteth a maiden he faith
unto her:</p>

<p>“Beloved, <em>I adore</em> the waves and frivols of
thy hair! The neatness of thy waistline is my delight;
and what <em>is</em> that subtile sachet which maketh
thee to remind me always of the rose of morning?”</p>

<p>But in his heart he saith:</p>

<p>“Yet, when we are married, then shall <em>I teach</em> her
not to wear false ringlets, and the imported complexion
which she now putteth on shall she abjure.</p>

<p>“Verily from the using of that <em>awful scent</em> shall I
break her, and from the wearing of corsets shall I
rescue her! For we shall then be <em>one</em>, and I shall be
<em>that one</em>!”</p>

<p>And while a damsel seeketh to allure a man she
saith unto him:</p>

<p>“Thou art <em>so</em> sensible. Yea, I pray thee, continue to
wear a <em>comfortable</em> collar always; for why shalt
thou suffer for style’s sake? Lo, thy beard and thy
mustache, they are so <em>characteristic</em>; and in a soft
hat thou hast <em>real personality</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
But in her heart she muttereth:</p>

<p>“Go to! When I have him <em>safe</em>, then shall I entice
him to put on a high collar, even unto <em>four inches</em>;
and the shaving of his face will require but two
weeks! Yea, and that quaint top-piece shall he exchange
for a derby within the first month. For I
know <em>just</em> what he needeth!”</p>

<p>Verily, verily, even in the hour of their courtship, do
they prepare for <em>war</em>!</p>

<p>Even while she poureth his wine, doth she determine
that he shall become a teetotaler! Even while
he passeth her the sweetmeats doth he plan to put
her on a <em>diet</em>, ’ere she acquire embonpoint.</p>

<p>As enemies before the battle, do they exchange
civilities, saying “<em>How congenial</em> we are!”</p>

<p>For every woman thinketh to make a man over after
a <em>pattern</em>, and every man thinketh to remodel a
woman according to a <em>stock</em> ideal.</p>

<p>Yea, after the honeymoon each seeketh to trim the
other down and to add all the <em>modern improvements</em>.</p>

<p>Then give them the fruit of their labors, which is a
<em>mutual</em> shock!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> Daughter, she that heedeth my instructions
shall find a man easier to play upon
than a pianola.</p>

<p>Behold, she hath but to press the right key, and he
shall repeat all his repertoire, even unto the <em>confession</em>
of his sins.</p>

<p>Yea, verily, a man rejoiceth in confessions; and
nothing delighteth his soul so much as to <em>repent</em>.
For, then can he return unto his follies with a clear
conscience and renewed enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Go to! <em>Who</em> is so virtuous as an husband that hath
but <em>just</em> received a cold bath and his wife’s forgiveness?</p>

<p>Lo, he goeth forth feeling like unto an uncrowned
saint.</p>

<p>He is puffed up with <em>righteousness</em>.</p>

<p>Yet, before the night cometh, peradventure, he shall
again have wobbled from the straight and narrow
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
How long, then, oh my Daughter, shalt thou encourage
men to persecute thee with their “I’m so-sorrys”,
and their “Never-agains”? For, verily,
verily, every man believeth that a woman’s patience
is a thing of India rubber, which will stretch over a
multitude of backslidings.</p>

<p>Yea, he hath not a <em>doubt</em> that a broken promise may
be glued together with kisses, and a broken heart
mended with softsoap.</p>

<p>Confessions are but the soothing syrup wherewith
he stilleth his conscience. And his sins would lack
much joy if he had not the pleasure of “<em>regretting</em>”
them.</p>

<p>But I say unto thee, a woman’s faith is like unto a
cobweb which cannot be patched up, once it hath
been shattered; and a woman’s heart is not as a
rubber ball, which reboundeth after it hath been
cast down.</p>

<p>Nay, a bride sobbeth “Harold, tell me <em>all</em>!”</p>

<p>But after ten years, a wife saith, “Do whatsoever
thou pleasest, but come not unto <em>me</em> with thy tale
of woe. Lo, I am aweary of holding onto Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
with one hand and onto <em>thee</em> with the other. Therefore
go thy ways and let me <em>sleep</em>!”</p>

<p>Verily, verily, in time, doth a man’s penitence <em>pall</em>
upon a woman; and his kiss of remorse is more to
be dreaded than his sins.</p>

<p>For, once love hath cooled, it <em>may</em> be warmed-over,
yet it is flat and tasteless, even as a Monday luncheon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> Daughter, observe my counsel, for the
heart of a man is like unto a Broadway
car, in which there is always room for
<em>one more</em>.</p>

<p>Behold, in matters of love, a woman is a <em>specialist</em>,
but a man is a <em>general practitioner</em>. Yea, a woman
loveth but one <em>type</em>&mdash;even <em>one man</em>&mdash;but a man loveth
anything which happeneth to be <em>at hand</em>.</p>

<p>Lo, he that weddeth a brunette shall ever after seek
peroxide blondes; and he that marryeth a pink and
yellow <em>doll</em> shall acquire a sudden interest in <em>intellect</em>
and <em>brunettes</em>. For <em>variety</em> is the spice of love.</p>

<p>Moreover, a woman is an epicure in love, but a man
is a gourmand.</p>

<p>In the love-feast, a woman desireth but one course
at a time; but a man relisheth them <em>all</em> served <em>at
once</em>, like unto a dinner at a country inn.</p>

<p>Yea, he mixeth his flirtations, even as he mixeth his
libations, and wondereth sadly why he awakeneth
always with an headache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Verily, verily, even thy Father, Solomon, had not
<em>more</em> than enough wives. For every man requireth
at least two soul-mates.</p>

<p>One for Sundays&mdash;and one for week days.</p>

<p>One to amuse him&mdash;and one to wait upon him.</p>

<p>One to save his soul&mdash;and one to save his pennies.</p>

<p>One to help him make a fortune&mdash;and one to help
him spend it.</p>

<p>One for his lighter side&mdash;and one for his darker side.</p>

<p>One for company, one for comfort, one for inspiration,
one for pastime&mdash;and many others, for
<em>a change</em>.</p>

<p>Thy cheek is as a Turkish towel, which caresseth

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Whatsoever thou hast done before, <em>that</em> shalt thou

<p>Thou kissest me once in the morning, once in the

<p>Thou clingest unto thine old pipe as unto thy

<p>Lo, what would my Beloved <em>be</em> without his habits?
Even as a doggie’s tail which hath lost its “wag”!
But thy <em>heart</em>, oh, my Beloved, is full of lightning
changes. Its capacity is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>The memory of yesterday’s kiss is unto thee as the
memory of yesterday’s dinner&mdash;sweet, but not satisfying.</p>

<p>Yet, though thy heart changeth many times, I, thy
wife, am become <em>one</em> of thy habits!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Song of Songs, which is the <em>widow’s</em>.</p>

<p>When I was a <em>rib</em>, I spoke as a rib, and all
my ways were the ways of a rib.</p>

<p>Lo, I took man <em>seriously</em>, even as he took himself.
For him did I rush the breakfast&mdash;and keep it waiting.</p>

<p>Unto him did I offer up the palm&mdash;and the morning
paper. All his opinions were right in mine eyes;
and because <em>he</em> said a thing, it was <em>so</em>.</p>

<p>He was the Lord of my Heart, and the Source of
mine Income. And in him I saw nothing <em>funny</em>;
for my sense of humor had not yet been awakened.</p>

<p>He looked at my hats and mocked them. Yet that
inverted salad bowl which he called a “derby” did
not arouse my mirth. He waxed satirical at the
number of my puffs, and my coiffure was a daily
target for his wit. Yet, though he cut all the hair
from off his head, and left it to grow upon his face,
I felt no merriment.</p>

<p>In his conceit he made of me a human joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
But now that I am become a widow, I see him as
he is. Therefore shall I arise and smite him in his
vanity.</p>

<p>Lo, what woman shall take men seriously, once she
hath been married unto one of these? For he, that
seemeth a thing of beauty and wisdom unto many
virgins, is but a child in the eyes of his wife.</p>

<p>She knoweth the source of his opinions; and the
padding of his shoulders is not hidden from her.
His grouches are always with her and his digestion
is her burden.</p>

<p>Go to! I have seen him at his mirror when he
worked upon the parting of his hair. He hath borrowed
my powder for his chin, and with my perfume
hath he anointed himself. My nail-polish and
my eau de cologne, they were not safe from him.</p>

<p>I have flattered him and beheld his fall. I have said
unto him, “My love, thy judgment is above question
and thy common sense above praise!”</p>

<p>And he hath smiled, as one that sippeth a wine of a
rare vintage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
I have cooed unto him saying:</p>

<p>“Lo, thy reasoning powers and thine acumen are
greater than those of Sherlock Holmes!”</p>

<p>And I have observed his secret joy.</p>

<p>I have cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>why</em> didst thou not go upon the stage? For
thy shoulders are better than Faversham’s and thy
profile than E.&nbsp;H. Sothern’s!”</p>

<p>And he hath straightway <em>proposed</em>!</p>

<p>The youths of the land have I called “Mr. Smith”,
and the octogenarians addressed as “Silly Boy”.
The fat man have I called “graceful”, and the
ourang-outang, “distinguished”.</p>

<p>And all of these were overcome.</p>

<p>Their fairy tales have I outstripped with better fairy
tales, and their devices with more subtile devices.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, men are as toys in mine hand; and,
even as a child, do I delight to play with them.</p>

<p>Lo, she that fisheth for an husband, laboreth against
many odds, but she that fisheth for amusement
casteth her nets in pleasant waters, and they shall
return unto her heavy laden.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Litany of the Summer Girl, which she
chanteth continuously, morning and night.</p>

<p>Oh, Lord, deliver me from the deadliness of
the Summer Resort, and from all the deadly things
therein.</p>

<p>From the emptiness of moonlight evenings without
a Man, and the hollowness of life without a flirtation,
now preserve me.</p>

<p>From the sentimental grafter and the <em>platonic friend</em>
oh spare me!</p>

<p>For, the one seeketh after cheap flirtations, and collecteth
kisses, as a woman doth trading stamps.
And the other is as a wet powder-rag which sticketh,
but availeth nothing. Verily, verily, a breakfast-food
without sugar and cream is not more insipid than
one of these.</p>

<p>From college youths, which are fresher than spring
asparagus and more tender than spring lamb, oh,
deliver me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
From old bachelors, which are staler than last year’s
canned goods, and tougher than cold rarebits, oh,
preserve me!</p>

<p>From the hotel “phonograph,” which repeateth the
same old love-tunes night after night, year in and
year out, oh set me free!</p>

<p>From the <em>impressionist</em> that cometh down over Sunday,
deliver me!</p>

<p>For, when he hath loved me with all his heart, and
with all his mind, and with all his impudence, for an
whole <em>week-end</em>, he shall depart; and the scorners
shall delight in their ha-has and the whisperers say,
“She was but a temporary distraction!”</p>

<p>From the <em>summer widower</em>, that seeketh to return
unto flirtation by a by-path, oh, hide me! For lo, I
am not a consolation prize. Neither am I a grafter,
coveting other women’s troubles.</p>

<p>From all gossip, and freckles, and tan, and sand-in-the-shoes;
from the patronizing bride, and the youth
that playeth ragtime; from the bathing suit that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
shrinketh, and the nose that peeleth; from mosquitoes,
and cows and red ants; from hen parties,
and springless straw rides, and manless dances, oh,
deliver me!</p>

<p>Feed me with bon-bons and stay me with novels!</p>

<p>Lead me beside the full streams, where the fish are
plentiful and the fishing worthy of the fishermaiden;
that I may, peradventure, find, <em>one eligible</em>, who
shall rescue me from the Land of Innocuous Desuetude,
and usher me into the Kingdom of Matrimony!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Song of The Debutante which the Wise
Virgin chanteth in her heart:</p>

<p>Oh, Providence in thy mercy, I beseech
Thee, grant me these three:</p>

<p>A level head, a soft tongue, and a sense of humor!
And the greatest of these is a <em>sense of humor</em>.</p>

<p>Lo, I do not ask for wealth, neither for beauty, nor
for love; for, having a level head, and a soft tongue,
all these things shall be added unto me.</p>

<p>I sigh not for the charms of an houri; and curling
hair I shall not crave. Yea, though <em>one</em> husband be
all that is granted unto me in this day of Progressive
Matrimony, I shall not murmur.</p>

<p>Though my waist-line increaseth, year by year, and
my teeth depart one by one, I shall not be cast down.
For, a cheerful disposition shall sustain me, and the
smile that cometh not off shall keep me charming.</p>

<p>Though chorus girls marry above me; though I
never build mine own bungalow; though my frocks
be made over, and my complexion made up, I shall
not repine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
For, behold, I shall not take myself <em>seriously</em>, neither
be filled with false <em>illusions</em> concerning men.</p>

<p>Lo, a woman that regardeth herself seriously is a
human joke; and a woman that dallyeth with illusions
is as a babe that played with matches. She
burneth her own fingers.</p>

<p>Though my cooking be deadly, and my shoes “number
fives” I shall not despair. For a sense of humor
shall cover me as a mackintosh, off which the
lemons, that fate casteth at me, shall roll as water.
Verily, verily, a woman without a sense of humor is
as one that goeth into New Jersey clad in lace hose.
She layeth herself bare to constant <em>stings</em>; she suffereth
untold pangs.</p>

<p>Then grant me, I pray thee, this one panacea:</p>

<p>That I may laugh when men laugh, and the point of
their jokes shall not escape me.</p>

<p>That I may not tremble at their wrath; neither
wither under their sarcasm, nor repine at their
grouches.</p>

<p>And that, all the days of my youth, I shall dwell in
the enjoyment of life, repartee, and the pursuit of an
husband! Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Incline</span> thine ear, O, my Daughter! For this
is the Song of the <em>Bride</em>, which containeth all
the law and the “profits” of Matrimony.</p>

<p>I thank thee, O, my Beloved; for thou hast chosen
me out of the multitude of women that were
<em>after</em> thee.</p>

<p>Thou hast delivered me from spinsterhood and led
me into the House of Bondage.</p>

<p>Thy <em>brand</em> is upon me!</p>

<p>I am thy Chattel.</p>

<p>Thy wishes shall be my wishes, thy tastes my tastes,
and thy politics my politics.</p>

<p>I shall have no personal opinions before thine and
no other thought before <em>thee</em>. Only my <em>tooth brush</em>
shall remain of all mine individuality.</p>

<p>For lo, I have said in my heart, “Couldst thou love
this man in a shop-made suit and a polka dot tie?
Couldst thou love him though he lost his front hair?
Couldst thou love him <em>without</em> a collar?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
And my heart hath answered:</p>

<p>“Yea, verily! For I am the apple of his eye, and he
is the source of mine income. Therefore are we truly
<em>mated</em>.”</p>

<p>Then, whatsoever thou doest, my beloved, it shall be
right in my sight; and whatsoever thou wearest thou
shalt seem beautiful in mine eyes.</p>

<p>Even in thy <em>fishing</em> clothes shall I adore thee; and
if thou but concedest to change thy collar and carry
<em>one</em> glove when we go forth in public thou shalt appear
sufficiently dressy unto <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>I shall take great care of thy digestion, and thy devotion
will take care of itself. I shall <em>not</em> practise
my cooking upon thee.</p>

<p>I shall believe whatsoever thou tellest me, even when
I know it to be <em>false</em>. I shall listen unto thy <em>fairy
tales</em> with respect.</p>

<p>I shall <em>delight</em> in thine imagination and the works
thereof.</p>

<p>I shall endeavor to like thee; for love passeth as the
whirlwind, but friendship is a rock which endureth
forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
I shall not laugh at thee, for I am <em>sane</em>.</p>

<p>When thou hookest my frocks crooked I shall not
murmur, but shall urge thee on with my cheers and
praises. I shall not hear thy mutterings.</p>

<p>I shall remember thy pipe, thy razor, and thy morning
newspaper, to keep them holy.</p>

<p>Thy Desk shall be sacred from mine hands. Thou
shalt have <em>one hook</em> within the closet.</p>

<p>I shall be a <em>mother</em> unto thee; yet shall I permit thee
to treat me as a <em>babe</em>, that thou mayest rest under
thy favorite delusion. Whosoever speaketh against
thee I shall rend her with my finger nails and my
sarcasm.</p>

<p>I shall learn to be happy <em>without</em> thee in order that
I may be happy <em>with</em> thee, when thou chancest to be
at home.</p>

<p>Thou shalt go thy ways untroubled; for I shall not
be thy jailer but thy jollier.</p>

<p>Verily, verily, I shall be <em>all</em> things unto thee; even
a wife, an angel, a kitten, a cook, a chum, and a
siren.</p>

<p>Yea, I shall be thine <em>whole harem</em>!</p>

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
